What is Taskhive?

Taskhive is a lightweight task/project management app built for learning and quick demos. It includes:

Projects and tasks (create / edit / delete)

Task assignment and statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done)

Deadlines and simple progress tracking

Responsive UI for desktop and mobile

(Adjust this list to match the actual features in your repo.)

Quick — Open in CodeSandbox (manual)

Go to codesandbox.io
.

Click Create Sandbox → Import Project → Import from GitHub.

Paste the GitHub repo URL:
https://github.com/pgera1/Taskhive

CodeSandbox will import and start the project automatically.

If the repo has a root package.json, CodeSandbox will detect it and run the dev server.

If the project requires a backend server, CodeSandbox may not run the backend automatically — consider using a mock API or deploying the backend elsewhere and configuring environment variables.

Run locally

Clone the repo and run it on your machine.
